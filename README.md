# vstack-server-demo

A complete server-side example of the Vstack library. The domain consists of `Employee` and `Employer` objects. Services expose CRUD operations on the domain objects using mappers, converters, and filters. The project uses a local database that will be automatically created for you when you run the project and displays output through command line interface.
