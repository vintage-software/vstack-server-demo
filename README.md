# vstack-server-demo

A complete server-side example of the Vstack library. The domain consists of `Employee` and `Employer` objects. Services expose CRUD operations on the domain objects using mappers, converters, and filters. The project uses a local database that will be automatically created for you when you run the project and displays output through command line interface.

This project targets .Net version 4.6 and uses the following Vstack projects:
- [Vstack Services](https://github.com/vintage-software/vstack-services)
- [Vstack Utilities](https://github.com/vintage-software/vstack-utilities)
- [Vstack Extensions](https://github.com/vintage-software/vstack-extensions)
